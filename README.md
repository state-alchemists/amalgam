# Amalgam

A case study of creating a microservices-ready/modular monolith.

In this repo, you can see:

- how to generate microservices-ready monolith
- how to run your application as a monolith
- how to split and run the same application as microservices
- how to deploy to Kubernetes (using docker-desktop)

# What is a microservices-ready monolith?

Microservices-ready monolith is a monolith application that can be split and deployed as microservices.

We can create a microservices-ready monolith by using:

- Feature flags
- Interface and layered architecture

Please visit [this guide](myProject/myApp/_docs/README.md) for more information.

Microservices-ready monolith has all the advantages of a monolith app. One of those advantages is simplicity.

When done correctly, you can split the monolith into independent microservices. You can even rewrite some modules with different technologies/programming languages.

# How to re-generate

```bash
./init.sh
```

More than 90% of this repository was generated by using Zaruba.

Please open [init.sh](init.sh) to see how we do it.

# How to run your application as a monolith

```bash
cd myProject
zaruba please startMyApp

# (or run as container)
# zaruba pleaase startMyAppContainer
# (ctrl + c)
# zaruba please stopContainers
```
